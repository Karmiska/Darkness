winding order 	= CCW (Counter Clock Wise) (same as OBJ files)
handedness	= right handed = +X right, +Y up, +Z towards camera (towards viewer)
inverse Z	= near 1.0, far 0.0
matrix major	= row major (same as direct X)




clip space on dx12	= +X right, +Y up, +Z away from camera (towards far 0.0)
speculation: how ever with inversed Z, +Z actually comes towards the viewer and
this seems to be currently the case
